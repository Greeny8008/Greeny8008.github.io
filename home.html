             <li>My main role at L&amp;C (Mortgage &amp; Protection Adviser) consisted of:<br>
- Working directly with clients and lenders to achieve the best possible deal for the customer.
<br>
- Having the ability to understand the customers needs and requirements whilst still ensuring I was giving reliable and realistic advice.
<br>
- Achieving my monthly targets from the first month to the last.
<br>
- Encouraging customers to think about other aspects of their finances, such as; insurance and pensions.</li>
<<<<<<< HEAD
             <li>I pride myself on the fact that I have always been able to achieve more than is expected of me. For example, I was able to surpass my targets and pass my probation in record time (2 months before expected) when I first started advising, this meant that I was signed off as competent and was trusted to advise under less supervision. I had solidified myself at the top of the stats by being extremely consistent and precise by the time I left the company.</li>
             <li>I was viewed as a very efficient and hardworking adviser whilst being famed for being so un-affected by stress and my surroundings compared to others.</li>
             <li>I am usually very quick to gain my seniors support after they have been able to witness my unmatchable drive and determination to be the best as what I do.</li>
